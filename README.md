How to install:

NOTE: this only works if you use https://aisdblend.instructure.com/

1. upload the python code to your IDE, I use pycharm, make sure to include the html file in a templates folder too, heres what mine looks like ![image](https://github.com/BigFish003/Assignment-Tracker/assets/89654438/ea6c6c7d-653c-4372-8b8a-4afe0669b780)
2. run the flask server and copy the http server it gives you ![image](https://github.com/BigFish003/Assignment-Tracker/assets/89654438/1efa9f7e-f6a2-48d2-a2e0-9c0883e8d7ac)
3. add /api to the end of that url so this one would be http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
4. paste that url into the content.js in the fetch command on line 28 ![image](https://github.com/BigFish003/Assignment-Tracker/assets/89654438/fd1db885-19ce-4493-90c5-edefe0aa1e17)
